This notebook is the introduction to my work on the ESLR recruitment project

This project is divided into different notebooks: 
- A notebook where I explore the data and apply pre-processing techniques to it (Prepare_data.ipynb)
- A notebook where I implement a simple classification model (Basic_model.ipynb)
